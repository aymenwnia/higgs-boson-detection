# higgs-boson-detection
This project, part of a larger Higgs boson detection initiative, focuses on training and optimizing Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) models. It compares XGBoost, LightGBM, and scikit-learn implementations on a precompiled dataset. Users can switch between standard training and RandomizedSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization.
